### SQL Solution

```SQL
select 
    e.name as Employee

from employee as e  -- represent e as employee table
left join employee as m on m.id = e.managerId  -- left join (self-join) the employee table to represent manager data (m)
where m.salary < e.salary -- look for higher than manager salary in employee salary data
```
