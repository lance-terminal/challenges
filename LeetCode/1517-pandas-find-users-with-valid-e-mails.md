# [1517. Find Users With Valid E-Mails](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-users-with-valid-e-mails/)

Table: `Users`
```SQL
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| mail          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
```
`user_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information of the users signed up in a website. Some e-mails are invalid.
Write a solution to find the users who have valid emails.
A valid e-mail has a prefix name and a domain where:
    The prefix name is a string that may contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, underscore '_', period '.', and/or dash '-'. The prefix name must start with a letter.

    The domain is `'@leetcode.com'`.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
`Users` table:
```SQL
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| user_id | name      | mail                    |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| 1       | Winston   | winston@leetcode.com    |
| 2       | Jonathan  | jonathanisgreat         |
| 3       | Annabelle | bella-@leetcode.com     |
| 4       | Sally     | sally.come@leetcode.com |
| 5       | Marwan    | quarz#2020@leetcode.com |
| 6       | David     | david69@gmail.com       |
| 7       | Shapiro   | .shapo@leetcode.com     |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
```
Output: 
```SQL
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| user_id | name      | mail                    |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
| 1       | Winston   | winston@leetcode.com    |
| 3       | Annabelle | bella-@leetcode.com     |
| 4       | Sally     | sally.come@leetcode.com |
+---------+-----------+-------------------------+
```
Explanation: 
The mail of user 2 does not have a domain.
The mail of user 5 has the # sign which is not allowed.
The mail of user 6 does not have the leetcode domain.
The mail of user 7 starts with a period.

```python
import pandas as pd

def valid_emails(users: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return users[users["mail"].str.match(r"^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*\@leetcode\.com$")]
```

In general, if you are asked to match a string, writing a regular expression pattern to match on should come first to mind.

RegEx provides various functionality, here are a few relevant ones:

    `^`: This represents the start of a string or line.

    `[a-z]`: This represents a character range, matching any character from a to z.

        `[0-9]`: This represents a character range, matching any character from 0 to 9.

        `[a-zA-Z]`: This variant matches any character from a to z or A to Z. Note that there is no limit to the number of character ranges you can specify inside the square brackets -- you can add additional characters or ranges you want to match.

        `[^a-z]`: This variant matches any character that is not from a to z. Note that the ^ character is used to negate the character range, which means it has a different meaning inside the square brackets than outside where it means the start.

    `[a-z]*`: This represents a character range, matching any character from a to z zero or more times.

    `[a-z]+`: This represents a character range, matching any character from a to z one or more times.

    .``: This matches exactly one of any character.

    `\.`: This represents a period character. Note that the backslash is used to escape the period character, as the period character has a special meaning in regular expressions. Also note that in many languages, you need to escape the backslash itself, so you need to use \\..

    The dollar sign: This represents the end of a string or line.
